    <h1>My Favorites</h1>
    <p>
      Not necessarily my absolute favorite things among all things that have
      been and are, but these are probably... somewhere on the list. Honestly
      most of this is going to be whatever I though of first, sorry if you were
      expecting introspection.
    </p>
    <h2>Food</h2>
    <p>
      I like a lot of food. (I'm not feeling clever right now) Here is
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fruit_preserves" target="_blank">a link</a> to the wikipedia article for fruit preserves(totally not reused I swear on... two strands of hair). (actually worrying I could only think of two things) Below I will include a (definitely not reused) image of food (I actually sound like a robot but I'm going to hope I'm not being graded on how innovative my interests are): </p>

    <h2>Video Games</h2>
    <p>I play a few different video games, notably:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Splatoon" target="_blank">Splatoon 2 and 3</a></li>
      <img src="" alt="(squid image)" width="300"/>
      <p>
        Fun online game (Realeased only on Nintendo Switch) about squid and octopus people who paint walls and floor and sometimes shoot
        each other and/or commit horrible war crimes(not a gameplay feature). Alternatively, there is a story mode where you navigate a
        post-apocaliptic rocket launch site, a cooperative mode where you fight
        fish to steal their children and almost die trying and then get paid in
        lottery tickets and sometimes a pair of shoes, and a 2 player card game. Splatoon 2 doesn't have the card game and has a different story mode, but the weapons availible for the player-versus-player modes are different and, due to the game being older, more numerous. All of the main and sub weapons were transfered to the third game, but a third type were almost all changed, so I do sometimes play the second game for that reason (Give me burst bomb Vdualies back). The design of the tools/weapons is very unique, while some are just water guns, others are fire hydrants, windsheild wipers, glue guns, umbrellas, tents, dual toothbrushes or hair dryers. The weapons are only availible in groups of 3, one main(water guns, paint rollers, paintbrushes, and swords, many of which are better suited to painting than they are to combat), one sub (usually bombs), and one special (a larger one that requires painting the floor to charge it up and activate it), and the groupings are different between the 3 games(If you use the hydra splatling, in comes with autobomb and booyah bomb in 3, where it has a different kit in 2. By the end of 2, most weapons had 3 kits to choose from) (I only have 2 and 3, as 1 was realeased on the Wii U, which I don't have).

      <li>Sky Children of the light</li>
      <img src="" alt="(Actually the worst screenshot I could have chosen to represent this game, but it's too big ehhh)" width="300"/>
      <p>
        A little social mobile game (also on Switch, Playstation, and soon PC), lots of character customisation. No ads, a
        few in-app-purchases, but just about everything you could buy with them
        can be obtained by other means (if only eventually, certain items are only availible during certain events for a couple weeks, like some party hats during the game's anniversary). There's not really much to do outside of
        interacting with other players, but they do have events quite frequently, many of which stay in some form after they officially end, so there isn't nothing do do. Outside of that, it is an absolutely gorgeous game, and its world is fun, even just to move around in (the controls are nice, at least on console) and take pictures of with the in-game cameras. (which might make finding photos for
        this hard, having to choose only a few)</p>
        <li>The Battle of Polytopia</li>
        <p> Also a mobile game, but very distinctly different. It's a stretagy game of sorts, where you build armies to capture enemy cities. Like Sky, there aren't ads, but the in-app purchases are more numerous, if overall significantly cheaper. You start with 4 of the game's 16 playable characters (tribes), and the rest all cost a dollar or two. The starting ones are varied and powerful though(they play very differently), and many consider two of them to be among if not the most powerful options in the game.</p>
        <li>The Legend of Zelda, Tears of The Kingdom</li>
        <p>That's a big one, this might take a while. Uh giant game, of course, just absolutely massive, take all that the previous game had (a LOT) and mulltiply it... by six!(exagerating... probably). So much to do and in all the time I've had it I've done... maybe 55%? There's a cooking system, in which I'm... far from an expert<img src="Img/Dubious_Food.webp" alt="(Dubious ''Food'')" width="30"/>(cooking mysterious glowing rocks is smart I swear) You can like use wierd magic stuff to create giant vehicles/weapons/send annoying NPCs to the upper atmosphere and honestly for that alone it's just fun to mess around in. The enemies are fun, the fusing adds layers to the combat the are distinct from the previous game. The bosses are awesome, a huge step above the previous game's ones, which, despite being amazing and challenging in their own right, were all very simlar. The final boss especially is gorgeously cinematic and a perfect mirror of Link's (the playable character's) abilities. Plus the healthbar expanding asymetrically just adds so much to the threat. Gorgeous, great soundtrack, great mechanics, great story, great locations, great everything.</p>

    <h2>Books</h2>
    <p>
      Just in general I read a lot, so I can't really pick a favorite book (or
      series), but I usually read fantasy or science fiction. Some books/series
      I enjoyed are:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Skyward by Brandon Sanderson</li>
      <img src="img/SkywardCover.jfif" alt="(Skyward Cover)" width="100"/>
      <p>
        I like most of Sanderson's books, including the rest of the Skyward
        series (and its spinoff), though I haven't read the prequel, but if I'm picking a
        favorite it's either this, one of the Secret Projects or The Emperor's
        Soul.
      </p>
      <li>Arc of a Scythe (series, book one is Scythe) by Neal Shusterman</li>
      <p>
        An interesting science fiction story with a unique setting (there's a
        short stories book too, set after and during the main story). Admittedly
        this book is in part here because I wanted to include books that weren't
        all written by the same author and this was one I'd read recently, but
        it is good nonetheless
        <li> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rick_Riordan" target="_blank">Rick Riordan</a></li>
        <p> I just put the author, as I don't remember which of his books i like best, but I read them a few years back and enjoyed them. I haven't read the most recent one though.</p>
